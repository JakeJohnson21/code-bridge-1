        Further analysis can be done to explore the increase in CO2 emission in
        most of the states right before 2020. The percentage of emission growth
        and traffic growth can be compared to understand the correlation between
        the two. A new analysis can also be done comparing the air traffic of
        states instead of airports and a choropleth map can be created to
        visualize the geospatial data.
